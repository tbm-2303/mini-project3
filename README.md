# mini-project3


1. We have made one simple regression model predicting price from sqft_living. This solution has an r2 score of: 0.49279845827805924
2. We have made one multi regression model with 'sqft_living', 'waterfront', 'grade' predicting price. This solution has r2 score of: 0.5715344932581723
3. We have made one multi regression model with 'waterfront' and 'grade' This solution has a r2 score of: 0.4820282483793493
4. We have made one multi regression model with all the features to predict price. This solution has a r2 score of: 0.7011904448878179

5. We possibly need to remove outliers from the dataset. This would maybe make it more accurate. The jupyter notebook contains tons of reflections and comments on how things could be improved.

6. We need alittle more practice with streamlit. We are aware of how to do it in a smarter way but its gonna take a couple more days of practice. maybe we can have a breif talk on thuesday in the classroom to address some of our doubts in regards to streamlit. We managed to make a very simple UI for one of the solutions for now.
